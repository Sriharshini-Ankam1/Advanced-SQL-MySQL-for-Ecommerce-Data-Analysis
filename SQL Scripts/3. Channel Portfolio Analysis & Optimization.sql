-- INSIGHTS:
-- - Gsearch consistently has more sessions than Bsearch.
-- - There's a peak in Gsearch sessions in mid-November, showing an increase in traffic.
-- - Bsearch remains relatively stable but lower than Gsearch.
-- - Gsearch appears to be a more dominant source of paid search traffic.

-- INSIGHTS:
-- - Mobile sessions contribute 24.52% of total traffic for Gsearch.
-- - Mobile sessions are only 8.62% of total traffic for Bsearch.
-- - Gsearch has a stronger mobile presence, indicating better reach in mobile advertising.
-- - Bsearch's mobile performance is relatively weak, suggesting a focus on desktop users.

-- INSIGHTS:
-- - Desktop conversion rates are higher than mobile for both Gsearch and Bsearch.
-- - Gsearch has a better conversion rate overall (Mobile: 1.28%, Desktop: 4.52%).
-- - Bsearchâ€™s mobile conversion rate is very low (0.76%), indicating a lack of mobile effectiveness.
-- - This suggests increasing the **desktop bid on Gsearch** while focusing on mobile optimizations.

-- INSIGHTS:
-- - Desktop sessions for **Bsearch are consistently about 40% of Gsearch sessions**.
-- - Mobile sessions for **Bsearch are only 8-12% of Gsearch mobile sessions**.
-- - Gsearch dominates both **desktop and mobile** sessions, making it the **stronger paid search platform**.
-- - Given the high performance of Gsearch, it may be beneficial to **increase ad spend on Gsearch** rather than focusing on Bsearch.
